= Game tools for personal use

A set of tools to handle game related stuff.

Current goals:

* Handle Linux Steam game files: uninstalling games leave behind folders (install and WINE prefixes) that need manual action.
On top of that, this is more complicated if you have multiple steam storage drives.

== Building and installing a distribution

 ./gradlew :steam-cleaner:installDist

The task will:

* build and install the bootstrap scripts and libraries in `${HOME}/.local/bin/game-tools-0.0.1-dev`.
* add 'steam_cleaner' to PATH
